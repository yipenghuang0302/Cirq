    """A sparse matrix wave function simulator that uses numpy.

    This simulator can be applied on circuits that are made up of operations
    that have a `_unitary_` method, or `_has_unitary_` and
    `_apply_unitary_`, `_mixture_` methods, are measurements, or support a
    `_decompose_` method that returns operations satisfying these same
    conditions. That is to say, the operations should follow the
    `cirq.SupportsConsistentApplyUnitary` protocol, the `cirq.SupportsUnitary`
    protocol, the `cirq.SupportsMixture` protocol, or the
    `cirq.CompositeOperation` protocol. It is also permitted for the circuit
    to contain measurements which are operations that support
    `cirq.SupportsChannel` and `cirq.SupportsMeasurementKey`

    This simulator supports three types of simulation.

    Run simulations which mimic running on actual quantum hardware. These
    simulations do not give access to the wave function (like actual hardware).
    There are two variations of run methods, one which takes in a single
    (optional) way to resolve parameterized circuits, and a second which
    takes in a list or sweep of parameter resolver:

        run(circuit, param_resolver, repetitions)

        run_sweep(circuit, params, repetitions)

    The simulation performs optimizations if the number of repetitions is
    greater than one and all measurements in the circuit are terminal (at the
    end of the circuit). These methods return `TrialResult`s which contain both
    the measurement results, but also the parameters used for the parameterized
    circuit operations. The initial state of a run is always the all 0s state
    in the computational basis.

    By contrast the simulate methods of the simulator give access to the
    wave function of the simulation at the end of the simulation of the circuit.
    These methods take in two parameters that the run methods do not: a
    qubit order and an initial state. The qubit order is necessary because an
    ordering must be chosen for the kronecker product (see
    `SparseSimulationTrialResult` for details of this ordering). The initial
    state can be either the full wave function, or an integer which represents
    the initial state of being in a computational basis state for the binary
    representation of that integer. Similar to run methods, there are two
    simulate methods that run for single runs or for sweeps across different
    parameters:

        simulate(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order, initial_state)

        simulate_sweep(circuit, params, qubit_order, initial_state)

    The simulate methods in contrast to the run methods do not perform
    repetitions. The result of these simulations is a
    `SparseSimulationTrialResult` which contains, in addition to measurement
    results and information about the parameters that were used in the
    simulation,access to the state via the `state` method and `StateVectorMixin`
    methods.

    If one wishes to perform simulations that have access to the
    wave function as one steps through running the circuit there is a generator
    which can be iterated over and each step is an object that gives access
    to the wave function.  This stepping through a `Circuit` is done on a
    `Moment` by `Moment` manner.

        simulate_moment_steps(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order,
                              initial_state)

    One can iterate over the moments via

        for step_result in simulate_moments(circuit):
           # do something with the wave function via step_result.state

    Note also that simulations can be stochastic, i.e. return different results
    for different runs.  The first version of this occurs for measurements,
    where the results of the measurement are recorded.  This can also
    occur when the circuit has mixtures of unitaries.

    Finally, one can compute the values of displays (instances of
    `SamplesDisplay` or `WaveFunctionDisplay`) in the circuit:

        compute_displays(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order, initial_state)

        compute_displays_sweep(circuit, params, qubit_order, initial_state)

    The result of computing display values is stored in a
    `ComputeDisplaysResult`.

    See `Simulator` for the definitions of the supported methods.
