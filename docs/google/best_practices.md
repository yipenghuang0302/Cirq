# Best Practices

This section lists some best practices for creating a circuit that performs well
on Google hardware devices. This is an area of active research, so users are
encouraged to try multiple approaches to improve results.

This guide is split into three parts:
*  Getting your circuit to run
*  Making it run faster
*  Lowering error


## Getting a circuit to run on hardware

In order to run on hardware, the circuit must only use qubits and gates that the
device supports.  Using inactive qubits, non-adjacent qubits, or non-native
gates will immediately cause a circuit to fail.

Validating a circuit with a device, such as
`cirq.google.Sycamore.validate_circuit(circuit)` will test a lot of these
conditions.  Calling the `validate_circuit` function will work with any
device, including those retrieved directly from the API using the
[engine object](./specification.md#serializable-devices), which can help
identify any qubits used in the circuit that have been disabled on the actual
device.


### Using built-in optimizers as a first pass

Using built-in optimizers will allow you to compile to the correct gate set. As they are
automated solutions, they will not always perform as well as a hand-crafted solution, but
they provide a good starting point for creating a circuit that is likely to run successfully
on hardware. Best practice is to inspect the circuit after optimization to make sure
that it has compiled without unintended consequences.

```python
import cirq
import cirq.google as cg


# Create your circuit here
my_circuit = cirq.Circuit()

# Convert the circuit onto a Google device.
# Specifying a device will verify that the circuit satisfies constraints of the device
# The optimizer type (e.g. 'sqrt_iswap' or 'sycamore') specifies which gate set
# to convert into and which optimization routines are appropriate.
# This can include combining successive one-qubit gates and ejecting virtual Z gates. 
sycamore_circuit = cg.optimized_for_sycamore(my_circuit, new_device=cg.Sycamore, optimizer_type='sqrt_iswap')
```

## Running circuits faster

The following sections give tips and tricks that allow you to improve your
repetition rate (how many repetitions per second the device will run). 

This will allow you to make the most out of limited time on the
device by getting results faster. The shorter experiment time may
also reduce error due to drift of qubits away from calibration.

There are costs to sending circuits over the network, to compiling each
circuit into waveforms, to initializing the device,
and to sending results back over the network.
These tips will aid you in removing some of this overhead by combining your
circuits into sweeps or batches.

### Use sweeps when possible

Round trip network time to and from the engine typically adds latency on the order of a second
to the overall computation time.  Reducing the number of trips and allowing the engine to
properly batch circuits can improve the throughput of your calculations.  One way to do this
is to use parameter sweeps to send multiple variations of a circuit at once.

One example is to turn single-qubit gates on or off by using parameter sweeps.
For instance, the following code illustrates how to combine measuring in the
Z basis or the X basis in one circuit.

```python
import cirq
import sympy
q = cirq.GridQubit(1, 1)
sampler = cirq.Simulator()

# STRATEGY #1: Have a separate circuit and sample call for each basis.
circuit_z = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.measure(q, key='out'))
circuit_x = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.H(q),
    cirq.measure(q, key='out'))
samples_z = sampler.sample(circuit_z, repetitions=5)
samples_x = sampler.sample(circuit_x, repetitions=5)

print(samples_z)
# prints
#    out
# 0    0
# 1    0
# 2    0
# 3    0
# 4    0

print(samples_x)
# prints something like:
#    out
# 0    0
# 1    1
# 2    1
# 3    0
# 4    0

# STRATEGY #2: Have a parameterized circuit.
circuit_sweep = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.H(q)**sympy.Symbol('t'),
    cirq.measure(q, key='out'))

samples_sweep = sampler.sample(circuit_sweep,
                               repetitions=5,
                               params=[{'t': 0}, {'t': 1}])
print(samples_sweep)
# prints something like:
#    t  out
# 0  0    0
# 1  0    0
# 2  0    0
# 3  0    0
# 4  0    0
# 0  1    0
# 1  1    1
# 2  1    1
# 3  1    0
# 4  1    1
```

One word of caution is there is a limit to the total number of repetitions.  Take some care
that your parameter sweeps, especially products of sweeps, do not become so excessively large
that they overcome this limit.

### Use batches if sweeps are not possible

The engine has a method called `run_batch()` that can be used to send multiple
circuits in a single request.  This can be used to increase the efficiency
of your program so that more repetitions are completed per second.

The circuits that are grouped into the same batch must
measure the same qubits and have the same number of repetitions for each
circuit.  Otherwise, the circuits will not be batched together
on the device, and there will be no gain in efficiency.


### Flatten sympy formulas into symbols

Symbols are extremely useful for constructing parameterized circuits (see above).  However,
only some sympy formulas can be serialized for network transport to the engine.
Currently, sums and products of symbols, including linear combinations, are supported.
See `cirq.google.arg_func_langs` for details.

The sympy library is also infamous for being slow, so avoid using complicated formulas if you
care about performance.  Avoid using parameter resolvers that have formulas in them.

One way to eliminate formulas in your gates is to flatten your expressions.
The following example shows how to take a gate with a formula and flatten it
to a single symbol with the formula pre-computed for each value of the sweep:

```python
import cirq
import sympy

# Suppose we have a gate with a complicated formula.  (e.g. "2^t - 1")
# This formula cannot be serialized
# It could potentially encounter sympy slowness.
gate_with_formula = cirq.XPowGate(exponent=2 ** sympy.Symbol('t') - 1)
sweep = cirq.Linspace('t', start=0, stop=1, length=5)

# Instead of sweeping the formula, we will pre-compute the values of the formula
# at every point and store it a new symbol called '<2**t - 1>'
sweep_for_gate, flat_sweep = cirq.flatten_with_sweep(gate_with_formula, sweep)

print(repr(sweep_for_gate))
# prints:
# (cirq.X**sympy.Symbol('<2**t - 1>'))

# The sweep now contains the non-linear progression of the formula instead:
print(list(flat_sweep.param_tuples()))
# prints something like:
# [(('<2**t - 1>', 0.0),),
#  (('<2**t - 1>', 0.18920711500272103),),
#  (('<2**t - 1>', 0.41421356237309515),),
#  (('<2**t - 1>', 0.681792830507429),),
#  (('<2**t - 1>', 1.0),)]
```

## Improving circuit fidelity

The following tips and tricks show how to modify your circuit to
reduce error rates by following good circuit design principles that
minimize the length of circuits.

Quantum Engine will execute a circuit as faithfully as possible.
This means that moment structure will be preserved. That is, all gates in a
moment are guaranteed to be executed before those in any later moment and
after gates in previous moments.  Many of these tips focus on having a
good moment structure that avoids problematic missteps that can cause
unwanted noise and error.

### Short gate depth

In the current NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era, gates and devices still
have significant error. Both gate errors and T1 decay rate can cause long circuits
to have noise that overwhelms any signal in the circuit.

The recommended gate depths vary significantly with the structure of the circuit itself
and will likely increase as the devices improve. Total circuit fidelity can be roughly
estimated by multiplying the fidelity for all gates in the circuit. For example,
using a error rate of 0.5% per gate, a circuit of depth 20 and width 20 could be estimated
at 0.995^(20 * 20) = 0.135. Using separate error rates per gates (i.e. based on calibration
metrics) or a more complicated noise model can result in more accurate error estimation.

### Terminal Measurements

Make sure that measurements are kept in the same moment as the final moment in
the circuit.  Make sure that any circuit optimizers do not alter this by
incorrectly pushing measurements forward. This behavior can be avoided by
measuring all qubits with a single gate or by adding
the measurement gate after all optimizers have run.

Currently, only terminal measurements are supported by the hardware.  If you
absolutely need intermediate measurements for your application, reach out to
your Google sponsor to see if they can help devise a proper circuit using
intermediate measurements.


### Keep qubits busy

Qubits that remain idle for long periods tend to dephase and decohere. Inserting a
[Spin Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_echo) into your circuit onto
qubits that have long idle periods, such as a pair
of involutions, such as two successive Pauli Y gates, will generally increase
performance of the circuit.

### Delay initialization of qubits

The |0⟩ state is more robust than the |1⟩ state. As a result, one should
not initialize a qubit to |1⟩ at the beginning of the circuit until shortly
before other gates are applied to it.

### Align single-qubit and two-qubit layers

Devices are generally calibrated to circuits that alternate single-qubit gates with
two-qubit gates in each layer. Staying close to this paradigm will often improve
performance of circuits.  This will also reduce the circuit's total duration,
since the duration of a moment is its longest gate.  Making sure that each layer
contains similar gates of the same duration can be challenging, but it will
likely have a measurable impact on the fidelity of your circuit.

Devices generally operate in the Z basis, so that rotations around the Z axis will become
book-keeping measures rather than physical operations on the device. These
virtual Z operations have zero duration and have no cost, if they add no moments
to your circuit.  In order to guarantee that they do not add moments, you can
make sure that virtual Z are aggregated into their own layer.  Alternatively,
you can use the `EjectZ` optimizer to propagate these Z gates forward through
commuting operators.

See the function `cirq.stratified_circuit` for an automated way to organize gates
into moments with similar gates.

### Refitting gates

Virtual Z gates (or even single qubit gates) can be added to adjust for errors
in two qubit gates.  Two qubit gates can have errors due to drift, coherent
error, or other sources.  Refitting these gates and adjusting the circuit for
the observed unitary of the two qubit gate compared to the ideal unitary can
substantially improve results.  However, this approach can use a substantial
amount of resources, and the methods to do this are currently under active
research and change.  Talk to your Google sponsor for details.
