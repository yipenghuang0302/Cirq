Cirq: A python library for NISQ circuits
========================================

Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and then running them against quantum computers and simulators.
Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of abstracting them
away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime, these
details determine whether or not it is possible to execute a circuit at all.

Alpha Disclaimer
================

**Cirq is currently in alpha.**
We are still making breaking changes.
We *will* break your code when we make new releases.
We recommend that you target a specific version of Cirq, and periodically bump to the latest release.
That way you have control over when a breaking change affects you.
