# This script will keep syncing a PR to master, waiting for its check to
# succeeds, and attempting to merge it; until either the PR is merged, the
# checks fail, or there are merge conflicts. After merging, it deletes the
# PR's branch (unless the branch is used elsewhere) and moves on to the next PR.
# The script does not skip a PR and go on to later PRs when the earlier PR
# enters an impossible-to-merge state; the script just stops.
#
# The commit message used by this script is the title of the PR, and for the
# message body it uses the body of the PR's initial message. So make sure those
# are good if you want good commit messages.
#
# Usage:
#     export CIRQ_BOT_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=[access token for your github account]
#     bash dev_tools/auto_merge.sh [PR#1] [PR#2] ...


# Get the working directory to the repo root.

# Do the thing.
